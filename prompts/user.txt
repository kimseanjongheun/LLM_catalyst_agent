[Context]
When the absolute value of the adsorption energy is close to 0 eV, high catalytic activity can be achieved.
This analysis focuses on *H adsorption energy.
Constraint: Among the 50 candidate compositions below, please use prior knowledge, general catalytic chemistry principles, and the given context to select only the top 1–3 most promising candidates.

While you are encouraged to rely on scientific reasoning and chemical intuition, you may use DFT calculations selectively to support or validate critical decisions — avoid brute-force evaluation of all candidates.

[Search Group]
{{ search_group.description }}
There are a total of {{ search_group.count }} candidate compositions.
